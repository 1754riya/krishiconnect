Via KrishiConnect, we wishes to revolutionize how the consumer industry in the agriculture sector functions, remove any middlemen that hamper our farmer friends from achieving the economic prosperity which they deserve. While we’ve built this website to be aesthetically pleasing and interactive and easy to use for our clients, we’ve also kept in mind to encourage both the parties participating in each and every transaction to have utmost satisfaction with our platform. 
Our website will make the farmers aware of various government policies meant to help and further agro-technology in the country as well as find useful tips to practise sustainable methods of farming. Alongside this, there's also the option of getting services like soil-testing, water-testing , etc to help our farmer friends prosper and see an increase in production. By removing middlemen, KrishiConnect will ensure that the farmers get the pay they deserve.
